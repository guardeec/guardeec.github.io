    "Thank you for banking with Barclays.\n",
    "Introducing our agreement, including who it applies to\n",
    "When you open a current or savings account with us, you\u2019re setting up an agreement. This is between Barclays Bank UK PLC (or another company we transfer it to) and you \u2013 the person or people we\u2019ve opened the account for.\n",
    "This booklet contains most of the terms and conditions of the agreement (which we also call our \u2018Retail Customer Agreement\u2019). The agreement covers all our personal banking accounts and any services we tell you it applies to when you start using them.\n",
    "We may also give you additional terms and conditions when you take out an account or service, such as an arranged overdraft or savings account. Those additional terms take priority over any others. Our agreement is made up of all of the terms and conditions that apply to your account and any other services you have with us.\n",
    " In this booklet, there are two sections.\n",
    " \u2022 Being with Barclays. This contains the terms and conditions that are central to how we and you work together. For example, they explain how we\u2019ll stay in touch.\n",
    " \u2022 Banking terms. These are terms and conditions that are more specific to how your current or savings account works. For example, they include how you can make a payment out of your account.\n",
    " Please ignore anything in this Retail Customer Agreement that doesn\u2019t apply to your type of account, or to the product or service you are using.\n",
    " What about charges?\n",
    " The Barclays Tariff for Personal Customers (\u2018Our Bank Charges Explained\u2019) shows charges for your personal account and services. You can find this Tariff at barclays.co.uk/rca.\n",
    " The Barclays Wealth Management Banking Tariff Guide shows charges for Barclays Wealth Management accounts and services. You can find this Tariff at barclays.co.uk/wealth-management/important-information/rates-and-fees\n",
    "   2 Barclays and you\n",
    " \n",
    " The International Banking Tariff Guide shows charges for Barclays International Banking accounts and services. You can find this Tariff at Barclays.co.uk/international-banking/terms\n",
    " These are what we mean when we talk about the Tariff.\n",
    " We\u2019ll give you a copy of the right Tariff when you open your account. We won\u2019t always tell you when charges in the Tariff change, so please make sure you have an up-to-date copy.\n",
    " You can ask for a copy of the terms and Tariff at any time. Ask at any branch or ring us. They\u2019re also on our website.\n",
    " Your account is just for personal use\n",
    " The terms in this booklet cover only accounts for personal use. They\u2019re not for money relating to any business you run. We can close an account (or stop providing a service) if we find out you are using a personal account for non-personal use.\n",
    " The only exception to this is if you\u2019re a Barclays Wealth Management Banking non-personal customer. If this describes you, the agreement does apply to the banking services we provide to you.\n",
    " Which country\u2019s courts and laws apply?\n",
    " Unless we tell you differently, this agreement is governed by English law, which also applies to setting up our relationship.\n",
    " If you want to bring a claim against us in the courts, you can do so using the courts of England and Wales. If you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland, you can bring a claim in the courts that are local to you.\n",

    " Where we can, we\u2019ll contact you using the method you\u2019ve told us you prefer. If you haven\u2019t told us, we\u2019ll normally contact you by email, via Online Banking or the Barclays app.\n",
    " When we send you information through Online Banking or the Barclays app, we\u2019ll send you an email, SMS or other electronic message to remind you to open it.

If we think any of your payment tools, such as cards, may have been compromised, we may send you a replacement to help keep your account secure.\n",
    ". You must not give your payment tools to anyone else. If someone takes money from your account because you have not kept your payment tools safe or secret when you should have done, you may lose all the money. There\u2019s more about this in the Banking terms (section 6: \u2018If someone takes an unauthorised payment from your account\u2019).\n",

    ".  Using e-wallets\n",
    ". You may store digital payment tools we give you in an e-wallet. (You won\u2019t be able to use e-wallets if you have a Barclays Basic Current Account.) You should treat the actions or devices you use to make a payment using an e-wallet as payment tools, and look after them just as carefully. Whenever we refer to a card, it will normally cover digital cards, such as those stored in an e-wallet, too.\n",
    ". 2 Keeping your money safe\n",
    ".  What is a \u2018payment tool\u2019?\n",
    ".  These are things you use to access your account and make payments that are personal to you. This is how we know we are dealing with you. They can include:\n",
    ". \u2022 a physical device, like a card\n",
    ". \u2022 a digital version of a card \u2013 in other words, the equivalent of card details but stored electronically on a device such as a computer or mobile. For example, Apple Pay or Contactless Mobile\n",
    ". \u2022 actions you have to take, such as using passwords, security keys, cards, personal identifier(s), fingerprints, and personal identification numbers (PINs).\n",
    ". The payment tool itself can be a combination of these (such as your card together with entering a PIN).\n",
    ". We may introduce new or different tools in the future.\n",
    ".  What is an e-wallet?\n",
    ".  An e-wallet is a digital version of a wallet where you store an electronic version of your payment tools, such as your debit card details. It may be a wallet app on your phone or on a merchant\u2019s website.\n",
    ". Using third-party services\n",
    ". You can use authorised third-party payment initiation service providers, card-based payment instrument issuers and account information service providers. But you mustn\u2019t share your Online Banking security details with them.\n",

    ". Not all accounts may be accessible to these providers.\n",
    ". Things you must not do\n",
    ". Don\u2019t choose a PIN or password that is easy for someone else to guess (such as 1234 or your date of birth).\n",
    ". Don\u2019t give your payment tools to someone else or let someone else use them.\n",
    ". Don\u2019t do anything that would let someone else use your payment tools. This includes writing them down in a way that someone else could understand. Don\u2019t keep the letter with your PIN in it. Don\u2019t let someone use a device like your phone that you keep your details on.\n",
    ". Don\u2019t sell your mobile device or send it for repair without first deleting the cards stored on it in e-wallets.\n",

    ". Nobody from Barclays will ever call to ask for a full PIN, password, passcode or a PINsentry-generated code. If anyone ever does this, hang up and call us again on one of our official phone numbers (on page 5). Use a different phone line to ring us because fraudsters can keep the original phone line open.\n",

We won\u2019t normally ask for all the account holders to give us instructions jointly. This means that one account holder can change your contact preferences for the joint account, make payments and apply for new products and services (like an overdraft) for all joint account holders.\n",

    ". If we know there\u2019s a dispute between people named on a joint account, we may insist that you jointly consent to what you are asking us to do. If that happens, we\u2019ll also turn off Telephone Banking, Online Banking and the Barclays app. We\u2019ll also suspend your payment tools (eg cards).

    ".  Paying in a foreign cheque: negotiating or collecting?\n",
    ".  Cheques in a currency other than sterling or drawn on a bank outside the UK could be cleared in one of two ways.\n",
    ". \u2022 If you need the money quickly, we may agree to negotiate the cheque. We trust that the cheque will clear. We pay the money in sterling into your account in advance on a date agreed with you. It\u2019s converted into sterling based on the Barclays reference exchange rate, to which we add a charge (margin). We do not have to negotiate a cheque. If we do, we\u2019ll deduct a charge for this from the amount we pay you.\n",
    ". \u2022 If we collect the cheque, it takes a bit longer. We\u2019ll send it to the paying bank for you. We then wait for the payment from the paying bank. The time this takes depends on each bank and the country it\u2019s based in. We\u2019ll then pay you the amount when we have cleared funds. We\u2019ll pay it either in the foreign currency if you have an account with us in that currency, or converted into sterling based on the Barclays reference exchange rate. We add our charge to this (margin). We\u2019ll tell you the charge before we collect the cheque.\n",
    ". The difference between the two ways\n",
    ". Collecting the cheque is slower but surer: it allows the cheque to clear before you get any money. Negotiating the cheque is faster. There\u2019s still a chance that, if something goes wrong or the cheque bounces, the other bank may return it or ask for the money back. We then have to take the money from your account again. The amount we send back is likely to be different from the amount we paid in. This could be because the exchange rate has changed. Or we could have deducted charges to cover our costs trying to get the money for you.\n",

    ".  About arranged overdrafts on sole or joint accounts. What happens if you enter into an unarranged overdraft\n",
    ".  Arranged overdrafts\n",
    ". If you want to borrow from us using your current account, you must apply for an arranged overdraft. This allows you to borrow up to an agreed limit.\n",
    ". Whether we agree to lend you money depends on your financial situation. If we do agree, we\u2019ll tell you the limit in a letter that contains the terms of the arranged overdraft. This is called a facility letter.\n",
    ". You have to pay interest at the rate we tell you in the facility letter. You pay this interest on the amount you\u2019re overdrawn (unless you\u2019re within any interest-free amount that applies to your account). We take the interest from your account once a month. On your statement, we\u2019ll tell you the amount of interest and the date we\u2019ll take it from your account. When we take fees and charges from your account, they reduce your balance or add to the amount you owe us.\n",
    ". We don\u2019t offer arranged overdrafts on Basic Current Accounts.\n",
    ". Unarranged overdrafts\n",
    ". We don\u2019t normally allow you to go overdrawn if you haven\u2019t agreed an overdraft with us first, or if it would take you over your arranged overdraft limit. We\u2019ll always try to refuse any payment that could take your account into unarranged overdraft.\n",
    ". On rare occasions, we might not be able to refuse. We don\u2019t charge interest on an unarranged overdraft, but you must pay the money back as soon as possible.\n",
    ". Arranged overdrafts are for occasional use\n",
    ". Arranged overdrafts are only for occasional use. You should make regular payments into your account to reduce the amount you owe us.\n",
    ". 47 Barclays and you | Our Banking terms\n",
    ". \n",
    ".  5 Borrowing money through your current account\n",
    ". We lend responsibly\n",
    ". Responsible lending is important to us, before and after we agree to lend money to you. If we think we should change or remove your limit(s), we\u2019ll tell you at the time. We can set a different limit, or cancel the arranged overdraft facility.\n",
    ". If you have an arranged overdraft and there have been no payments into or out of the account for 12 consecutive months, we\u2019ll assume you don\u2019t want or need the facility and remove it.\n",
    ". When you pay money into your account\n",
    ". When you put money into your account, we\u2019ll use it to repay any amounts you owe us. We do this in a set order.\n",
    ". 1 The money you put in goes towards repaying any unarranged overdraft. This is anything you owe us that\u2019s over what we\u2019ve agreed in advance.\n",
    ". 2 We pay towards your arranged overdraft.\n",
    ". 3 Anything left will credit your account.\n",
    ". We won\u2019t change this order or agree to use money you pay in for specific payments.\n",
    ". As with most banks, our overdrafts are repayable on demand. This means you must pay it back if we ask you to. We might ask for the whole amount, or part of it. We don\u2019t have to give you advance notice, but we\u2019ll try where possible.\n",
    ". Until you repay us in full, we may continue to charge interest. We can do this before and after any court order telling you to repay.\n",
    ". Borrowing on a joint account\n",
    ". You have a joint account if you hold an account with one or more people.\n",
    ". Each joint account holder is separately responsible for keeping to the terms of this agreement. You agree that the information we have to provide before giving you an overdraft will be provided to only one of you. We\u2019ll treat both or all of you as having agreed to the borrowing arrangement.\n",
    ". We can ask everyone named on the agreement, or just one or some of you, to pay back the whole amount you owe us. We can also decide to accept part payment from one of you. This doesn\u2019t mean we agree that the other(s) don\u2019t owe us the rest of the money. This is technically called \u2018joint and several liability\u2019. You are all \u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019.\n",

    ". \n",
    ".  5 Borrowing money through your current account\n",
    ".  What does \u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019 mean?\n",
    ".  If you are jointly and severally liable, it means we can ask each of you for a proportion of the debt (joint liability). If for some reason we can\u2019t collect the money from everyone, we have the right to collect it from just some or one of you (several liability).\n",
    ". Unincorporated associations such as clubs and charities\n",
    ". If an unincorporated association (such as a club, charity, society or other form of association) holds an account, there are authorised signatories. Unless we have agreed otherwise, each authorised signatory is separately responsible for complying with the terms of the agreement. You are each also jointly and severally liable for any money you owe us. This means that we have the right to demand repayment of the full amount owed, and not just a share of it, from all or any of the authorised signatories.\n",

If we paid too much, we\u2019ll only pay back the difference. We\u2019ll refund any interest or charges you have paid. If there was any interest on your account that you\u2019ve missed out on because of the mistake, we\u2019ll pay that back. We\u2019ll back-date this to when the money left your account. We\u2019ll refund you before the end of the working day after you tell us or sooner if we can.\n",
    ". We may be able to show that the other bank actually received the payment on time. If we can do this, the other bank is responsible for correcting the payment to the person you\u2019re paying.\n",
    ". Your payment might have gone through Confirmation of Payee (see page 30 for what this is). If you were told under this process that the name matched the sort code and account number you provided, and this was wrong, you may be entitled to recover any loss. In those circumstances, please contact us.\n",

    ". We\u2019ll try to help you get the money back. We may not always be able to do this, but we\u2019ll do all we can. We may charge a fee for tracing, recalling or cancelling a payment (you\u2019ll find this in the Tariff).\n",

    ". If you ask us to make a payment in the UK or the EEA in euro and it\u2019s late arriving, please tell us. For information on the times transactions should take, see sections 1 and 4 of the Banking terms. We\u2019ll contact the other bank and ask them to make up any interest their customer has lost. This is to make it the same as if the payment had arrived on time.\n",
    ". If we get a payment for you from another bank that isn\u2019t credited to your account when it should have been, we\u2019ll immediately credit your account with the right amount and make the money available to you. We\u2019ll also refund any charges you\u2019ve paid and refund or pay any interest we owe you. You\u2019ll then be in the same position as if you had received the payment when you should have done. For more information on when payments will be credited to your account, see sections 2 and 4 of the Banking Terms.\n",
